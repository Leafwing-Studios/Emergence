# Units

In *Emergence*, **units** are organisms that move, plan and act.

Like all organisms, they require resources to survive.
However, unlike [sessile organisms](sessile-organisms.md), they do not shrink when starved of resources.
Instead, they simply die.

## Work

Units can perform **work** when prompted, crafting to transform ingredients, amending soil, gathering resources from plants or so on.

The amount of work required for each [recipe](../production-chains/recipes.md) is measured in seconds, although various modifiers may make this faster or slower.
