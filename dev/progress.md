# Progress

Below are the current planned goals for the project.  

## Planned Features

* [ ] Build up a sprawling, complex factory-like colony that gathers resources from the environment, transports them through a complex supply network, and transforms them into outputs in a flexible fashion
  * [ ] Add an ant hill
  * [ ] Allow ants to gather resources
  * [ ] Add colony dynamics
  * [ ] Add functionality to `structures`
  * [ ] Add more `structures` to the game
  * [ ] Add layers of indirect control for the player

* [ ] Explore a procedurally generated 2.5D world that changes dramatically over both time and space
  * [ ] Finalize art style/basic assets
  * [ ] Add more creatures/forms of life to the game

* [ ] Create a self-sustaining, robust ecosystem that can adapt to even the most severe disruptions
  * [ ] Add ways to track environmental factors
  * [ ] Allow player's actions to impact environment

* [ ] Manage externalities, both positive and negative, and see the real effect of your actions on the water, soil and nutrients in your environment via rich information overlays and helpful charts
  * [ ] Model biofeedback loops in the environment
  * [ ] Add environmental info UI

* [ ] Experiment with unique forms of indirect control: nudge rather than command
  * [ ] Expand in-direct control
    * [ ] Add `SignalDesigner` gameplay element

* [ ] Domesticate and integrate new species that you encounter in the world, each with unique gameplay effects
  * [ ] Add new species
  * [ ] Add interacts between ants and other species

* [ ] Shape the path of evolution, speciating and mutating your organisms to specialize and empower them for the jobs you need done
  * [ ] Add genome
  * [ ] Make genome changeable via player action
  * [ ] Add inheritability

## Dev Goals

* [ ] Add `bevy_console` and `bevy_egui` to project
* [ ] Add and flesh out UI
* [ ] Test scalability
* [ ] Test gameplay loop
  * [ ] Expand and test gameplay loop (on going)

## Design Goals

* [ ] Flesh out art and world building
* [ ] Add new creatures
* [ ] Add new structures
* [ ] Rework world gen to fit art style
* [ ] Integrate affordance theory into game design
