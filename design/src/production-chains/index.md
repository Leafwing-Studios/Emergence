# Production chains

In a [factory builder](../high-level/genre-mechanics.md), resources are extracted, transformed and ultimately used.
They are extracted as [raw resources](raw-resources.md), are transformed into [intermediates](intermediates.md) are ultimately turned into useful [end products](end-products.md).

The paths that these **items** can travel on is dictated by the [recipes](recipes.md) available to the player.
