# Creative Automation

The core experience of factory builders is that of **creative automation**.
This is an important idea, so let's break down exactly what that means, and what supports and interferes with that experience.

## What is automation?

**Automation** is simple enough: things happening in a repetitive fashion without manual intervention.
This might be cars being riveted in an assembly line, the grinding of wheat into flour, or even the experience of watching crops grow.

Automation is satisfying in the same way that **contraptions** are:
you get to see the intricate parts working together in harmony, marvel at the complexity, and zoom in to understand how each part works.

Good contraptions are:

- full of interesting sounds and motions
- work together to achieve a common goal
- able to be understood by analyzing each part in isolation
- complex enough that they cannot be understood immediately

However, automation can be distinguished from pure contraptions because it accomplishes a **goal**.
These are not pure toys, endlessly pushing a ball up a hill.
Instead, they perform a task: commonly working with **resources**.
Resources are **produced** in some way, then **transformed**, and ultimately **consumed** to acheive some goal.

## What makes games "creative"?

**Creativity** in games is ultimately about self-expression:
the ability to change parts of the game world to reflect players' identity or vision for how something should look or work.

Successful creative games share four common factors:

- interesting goals
  - these can be set by the game, but cannot have a guided path to get there
  - achievements, tech unlocks, emergent gameplay needs and cosmetics are all very common drivers here
  - predefined quests and linear stories often reduce player creativity!
- high degree of player agency in how they reach those goals
  - players must be able to meaningfully change the mechanics or aesthetics of the world, their base or their avatar
  - multiple solutions to any given challenge should be possible!
  - solutions must be meaningfully different: simply changing the coat of paint rarely drives creativity
  - secondary objectives are really helpful to expand the space of interesting solutions
- low pressure
  - the player must be given the time, wiggle room emotional space to explore their options and make suboptimal choices
  - creativity often only comes after basic mastery over the game mechanics have been achieved
  - as a result, high pressure games can *become* creative!
- compelling aesthetics
  - creativity is often driven by the desire for beauty
  - engaging themes encourage players to **roleplay**, getting into character to achieve a cohesive look or feel
  - strongly opinionated character / world design can reduce creativity if there's not "variation on a theme" options as players are reluctant to break existing cohesion
