# Intent

**Intent** represents the hive mind's collective willpower and focus.
It regenerates over time, and can be spent at a significantly faster rate to influence and temporarily improve allied organisms.

## Using intent

Intent is primarily spent on spell-like:

1. Select which **ability** you would like to use.
2. Use your cursor to target an area.
3. Click and hold the left mouse button, spending intent at a fixed rate in that area.
4. The longer you hold down the mouse button, the more the effect strengthens, or the longer the effect lasts.

As a resource, small amounts of intent are also spent on other actions that reflect "collective intelligence":

- [zoning](zoning.md), with higher priority zoning costing more intent
- [terraforming](terraforming.md)
- when altering the [signal configuration](../signals/configuring-properties.md) of a strain
- changing the [recipe](../production-chains/recipes.md) of a building

This is both thematically appropriate and adds a gentle price to micromanagment.
These costs should be very low, and rapidly recovered: only planning or reconfiguring huge swathes of your factory at once should actually require waiting for intent to recover.

[Purely informational hive mind abilities](informational-tools.md) never cost intent (even if thematically it might be defensible) in order to reduce player frustration.

## Abilities

Intent can be used for several abilities, each of which is [unlocked](intent.md#unlocking-and-upgrading) as the player plays the game.

## Unlocking and upgrading

Intent is unlocked at the very beginning of the game, and narratively represents the first "consciousness" of the collective.

Additional abilities are unlocked via the [hive mind upgrade system](../research/hive-mind-upgrades.md) as the player accomplishes [milestones](../glossary.md#milestone), gating complexity behind demonstrated mastery.

Additionally, many organisms have a class of [genetic upgrade](../research/genetics.md) that improves or modifies how abilities influence that strain of the organism.

Similarly, some organisms will have genetic upgrades that will improve your intent generation, cost to use or capacity in a fashion that scales with the number of living organisms of that type.
These organisms serve as part of the hive mind's extended nervous system, increasing its capacity to sense, focus and reason.
