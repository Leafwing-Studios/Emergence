# Mapping genre mechanics to *Emergence*

## Core Mechanics

- **Resource patches**
  - environmental resources are typically (but not always) continuous, rather than discrete
    - still clumped, but no clear boundaries
    - ex: nitrogen can be extracted from soil, but will be richer in some locations
  - all resources can be obtained renewably, with the right strategy
  - soil contains various concentrations of nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium)
  - soil is physically made up of sand/silt/clay/stone/organic matter
  - water is vital for virtually everything, and can be found in rain, streams, lakes, organic items and soil
  - energy is similarly vital, but can be found in different forms that are edible to different organisms
    - ultimately gathered via photosynthesis
- **Recipes**
  - quite standard overall
  - emphasis on byproducts and consequences of unmanaged waste
  - circular processing
  - some items can decompose over time without action
- **Assemblers**
  - simple items can just be assembled by units at a crude shelf made of dirt (cheap) or stone (durable)
  - more complex items involve the use of dedicated plant or fungal buildings with selected recipes
- **Transporters**
  - ground units carry items and do work flexibly, but are physically grounded
  - water flows can be used to carry goods downriver
  - water flows can be expanded with player-dug canals
  - large quantities of goods can be transported via large, high-momentum ground units
- **Storage**
  - simple one-resource piles that are exposed to the elements
  - sheltered storage buildings made of stone, plants and fungi
  - shelted storage will reduce rate of decay, and mess due to rain and other effects
  - units, assemblers and storage work together in a fashion directly analogous to Factorio's logistic network
- **Resource sinks**
  - lossy conversions: energy and water will commonly be lost during resource transformations
  - resource upkeep: energy and water will commonly be lost to keep things alive
  - intent: used to exert control over the colony and interactively boost effectiveness
    - refine and then spend base resources to improve production rate
  - guided evolution: research analogue used to modify and enhance existing species
  - assimilation: research analogue used to add new species to the colony
  - hive mind: research analogue, used to unlock new features in the lab
  - ???: some kind of final goal to work towards building
  
## Advanced Mechanics

- **Distributed resource costs**
  - water is used by everything, with rate varying by temperature and humidity
    - ultimately replenished by rainfall
    - distributed via:
      - canals
      - mycorrhizal networks
      - water droplets
  - energy is used by everything, with rate varying by amount of work done
    - ultimately gathered via photosynthesis
    - distributed by:
      - items
      - mycorrhizal networks
- **Fluids**
  - transported via plant and fungal networks
  - transported via canals
  - can be pumped
- **Filters**
  - units are capable of differentiating between items
  - some units won't care about some items via signal preference tuning
  - simple mechanical filters sort items into classes
    - item size
    - floats
    - blows away
  - plants are capable of sophisticated filtration of solutions
- **Splitters**
  - streams that split
- **Prioritizers**
  - nonlinear signal feedback loops?
  - stream geometry?
- **Bypasses**
  - underground tunnels
  - overpasses
  - catapults?
  - bridges?
- **Spatial constraints**
  - rocks
  - trees
  - bodies of water
  - litter from extinct humans?
  - modifying the topology etc should be possible, but very expensive
- **Technology**
  - guided evolution: research analogue used to modify and enhance existing species
  - assimilation: research analogue used to add new species to the colony
- **Production enhancements**
  - intent: spent manually by the player to temporarily and locally enhance
  - upgrades: done via guided evolution, affecting all organisms of that strain
  - enhancements: higher quality fertilizers can be produced and applied automatically via workers
- **Multiple transportation options**
  - Many species, and species variants
- **Cyclic production pathways**
  - Core mechanic
- **Byproducts**
  - Core mechanic
- **Pollution**
  - thematically essential
  - needs much richer (and more plausible) model of pollution
  - effects should be varied and depend on intensity of pollution
  - polluting should be easier than dealing with waste products properly
  - pollution can serve as yet-another important driver of temporal variation, as it builds up and must be dealt with
  - several kinds:
    - solid waste
    - water pollution
    - soil pollution
- **Stochastic outputs**
  - Inherent in advanced tech
- **Degrading products**
  - Organic materials only
  - Most food
- **Hazardous goods**
  - Combat-focused items
  - Advanced tech
- **Environmental process bounds**
  - inherent to using living organisms as assemblers (and workers)

## Supplementary Mechanics

These features supplement the core gameplay loop by providing additional things to do or consider, but are not needed.

- **Exploration**
  - important but not essential
  - fairly standard implementation
  - needs more interesting world generation
  - water distribution and topography are key
- **Combat**
  - natural but not essential
  - must be careful to avoid snowballing effects
    - design with negative feedback loops like hunger satiation
