# Player Actions

*Emergence* uses an indirect, "god style" interaction paradigm common to colony sims.
You do not have a [player avatar](../glossary.md#player-avatar),
nor can you directly order units to move as in Real Time Strategy games.

Players have several actions at their disposal.
Generally, they must first use their [selection tools](selection-tools.md) to select an organism, tile, building or group thereof.

Then, they can use a handful of tools to alter the game world directly:

- [zoning](zoning.md), which control which structures should be in which location and perform teraforming
- [recipe selection](../production-chains/recipes.md), which changes what buildings are producing
- [signal configuration](../signals/configuring-properties.md), which modifies the signal production and preferences of a [strain](../glossary.md#strain)
- [pheromones](pheromones.md), which expend a limited but renewable resource to temporarily alter behavior and provide localized boosts

Players also have some options are simply used to [control the information](informational-tools.md) being displayed:

- selection details
- camera control
- map
  - notes
- overlays
- recipe lookup
- simulation sandbox
- encyclopedia

Finally, the player can engage in [research](../research/index.md) to enhance or unlock new options.
