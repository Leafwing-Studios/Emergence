# Organisms

Organisms are living things.
In *Emergence* there are several kinds:

- plants
- animals
- fungi

Every species of organism has a [life cycle](life-cycles.md), which determines how it reproduces, grows, changes and dies over time and with the environment.
These is broken into discrete **life stages** connected by **life paths**, in order to improve clarity and manage complexity for players.
The life cycle describes these stages, their properties, and the paths between them.

Organisms can be divided into [units](units.md) which move, and [sessile organisms](sessile-organisms.md) which do not.
