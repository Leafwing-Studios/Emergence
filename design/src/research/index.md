# Research

[Research](../glossary.md#research) is the primary mechanism of progression in the [factory builder genre](../high-level/genre-analysis.md).
Raw resources are transformed and then consumed to unlock new options and receive permanent boosts to effectiveness.

Research serves many goals:

1. Provide a meaningful, nearly limitless sink for raw resources.
   1. Most other resource sinks ultimately *improve* the rate of resource extraction and refinement!
2. Gate [complexity](../glossary.md#depth-and-complexity), by slowly unfolding options throughout the game.
   1. This feels more meaningful and is less patronizing as players can choose the order, and control the rate of unlocks.
3. Provides a sense of [progression](../glossary.md#progression) and rewards players for their successes.
4. Provide players with an outlet for mechanical [creativity](../high-level/creative-automation.md), by allowing players to choose how their playthrough unfolds.
   1. In most games, this effect is quite limited, as you are steadily unlocking a fixed tree with limited actual freedom.
5. Showcases late-game mechanics to let players plan and get them excited about how cool it's going to be.

In *Emergence*, there are three distinct forms of research: [domestication](domestication.md) (capturing new species), [genetics](genetics.md) (refining and branching existing species) and [hive mind upgrades](hive-mind-upgrades.md) (increasing information and direct player upgrades).
These are primarily split for thematic cohesion, but that choice also serves to increase system richness and add more interesting and distinct end goals.
