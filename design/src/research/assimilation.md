# Assimilation

When the player **assimilates** a species, they domesticate it, learning how to care for and reproduce it, and bringing it into the broader multi-species hive.

Assimilation serves several gameplay purposes:

1. Gate wildly different technology in a visually distinctive way.
2. Tutorialize the process of caring for a new species.
3. Give players a reason to care about and get excited by the flora and fauna they see around them.
4. Encourage players to explore new areas.

In order to assimilate a species you must:

1. Study the species in the wild for a time.
   1. You must observe key life cycle events, which unlocks that section of their encyclopedia entry.
2. Capture a number of specimens of a species.
3. Keep that population alive for several life cycles.

Once you have assimilated a new species, you unlock control over [genetics](genetics.md) for that species, and can build reproductive structures for that species.

## Implied Constraints

1. Players should be able to tame almost anything they meet.
2. Players must be able to clearly differentiate between tamed and wild organisms of the same type.
3. Species must be mechanically and visually distinct.
   1. You cannot have 3 species of dragonflies!
   2. This is because players must be able to clearly tell when an encountered species is new to them.
4. There must be a moderate number of species in the game.
   1. With too few species, players will get bored.
   2. With too many species, finding and understanding each species will explode complexity and development costs.
5. Exploration becomes an important game mechanic.
   1. Map cannot start fully visible.
   2. Different species must live in different regions.
6. Each species must have an interesting life cycle that players must learn about and master.
   1. Survival, feeding and reproduction are the obvious choices.
   2. Unique / interesting / challenging behavior is also a good option.
7. Progression must be robust: there must be many paths to the same resources and comparable tools.
   1. Each pathway should feel meaningfully distinct: this plays well with unique life cycles.
   2. [_Against the Storm_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1336490/Against_the_Storm/) and [_Oxygen Not Included_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/457140/Oxygen_Not_Included/) do a fantastic job of this.
