<h2 id="game-design"><a class="header" href="#game-design">Game Design</a></h2>
<p>Key concepts and terms from game design.</p>
<h3 id="accessibility"><a class="header" href="#accessibility">Accessibility</a></h3>
<p>How easy and/or comfortable a game is to play for players with a wide range of ability levels or impairments.</p>
<p>Vision, hearing and motor disabilties are the most common category here, but difficulty, time commitments and mental health concerns can also be reasonably considered under a broad banner of accessibility.</p>
<h3 id="achievements"><a class="header" href="#achievements">Achievements</a></h3>
<p>Rewarded for accomplishing challenging or interesting in-game tasks.
These are often associated with <strong>achievement points</strong>, awarded based on the difficulty of each achievement.</p>
<p>Can serve as an important form of <a href="glossary.html#tutorialization">tutorialization</a>, as it lays out [goals] for players to chase after (and are a good spot for hints).</p>
<p>Achievements typically tie into out-of-game systems on <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/achievements">Steam</a> or consoles to track accumulated achievements.</p>
<h3 id="agency"><a class="header" href="#agency">Agency</a></h3>
<p>The extent to which players feel like they can shape the broader <a href="glossary.html#narrative">narrative</a> or <a href="glossary.html#mechanic">mechanics</a> of the game.</p>
<h3 id="art-style"><a class="header" href="#art-style">Art style</a></h3>
<p>The techniques, colors, scale and elements that are used in the visual elements of a game.</p>
<h3 id="automation"><a class="header" href="#automation">Automation</a></h3>
<p>Repetitive work that is done automatically by in-game entities and systems.</p>
<h3 id="challenge"><a class="header" href="#challenge">Challenge</a></h3>
<p>Difficulty that is fun and rewarding for players to overcome.</p>
<h3 id="cohesion"><a class="header" href="#cohesion">Cohesion</a></h3>
<p>The degree to which game elements (usually <a href="glossary.html#theme">thematic</a> or <a href="glossary.html#art-style">artistic</a>) feel like they belong together as part of a greater whole.</p>
<h3 id="constraint"><a class="header" href="#constraint">Constraint</a></h3>
<p>A limitation of the <a href="glossary.html#design-space">design space</a>, which must (or should) be respected when doing game design.</p>
<p>Constraints can be:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>External:</strong> imposed by problems beyond the game designer's control. Budget, cultural sensitivity and market demands are common examples.</li>
<li><strong>Arbitrary:</strong> imposed by the designers themselves, in order to limit the design space in interesting ways.</li>
<li><strong>Internal:</strong> implied via existing elements of the game, or the combination of other constraints.</li>
</ol>
<p>While constraints are limiting, they're a powerful tool to create a more focused game and are great sparks for creativity.</p>
<p>Constraints exist on a continuum between <strong>soft</strong> (flexible, can be ignored with a good enough reason) and <strong>hard</strong> (must be respected at all times).</p>
<p>Constraints can be in <a href="glossary.html#tension">tension</a> with each other.</p>
<h3 id="cycle-mechanics-design"><a class="header" href="#cycle-mechanics-design">Cycle (mechanics design)</a></h3>
<p>A set of elements of the same type that share strong mechanical (and often thematic) similarities.</p>
<h3 id="design-by-stumble"><a class="header" href="#design-by-stumble">Design-by-stumble</a></h3>
<p>Making games is hard!
Starting with an existing, successful game is a popular and effective strategy.</p>
<p>However, you should critically examine the <a href="glossary.html#genre">genre</a> of the game you are starting from,
and identify clear areas to focus on and improve.</p>
<p>Otherwise, your game development process will proceed as if by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk">random walk</a>:
changes made without a reason are as likely to be harmful as helpful, and your game will be unfocused.</p>
<h3 id="design-space"><a class="header" href="#design-space">Design space</a></h3>
<p>The set of all possible games or solutions that obey all of the <a href="glossary.html#constraint">constraints</a>.</p>
<h3 id="depth-and-complexity"><a class="header" href="#depth-and-complexity">Depth and complexity</a></h3>
<p><strong>Depth</strong> is a fuzzy term that gets at the notion of game <strong>richness</strong>: how many interesting choices are there, how much replay value exists?</p>
<p><strong>Complexity</strong> is a similarly fuzzy term that attempts to capture a measure of the number of &quot;moving parts&quot; of a game, and how challenging it is to understand.</p>
<p>Depth is generally viewed as a positive attribute, while complexity is generally viewed as a negative attribute.
Games which have high depth relative to their complexity are often considered <strong>elegant.</strong></p>
<p>Dependending on their player base, games have a varying <strong>complexity budget.</strong>
This fuzzy term represents each player's ability to keep track of rules, learn new mechanics and reason effectively about their <a href="glossary.html#interesting-choices">choices</a>.
If this budget is exceeded, players will be frustrated and confused by your game.</p>
<h3 id="diagetic"><a class="header" href="#diagetic">Diagetic</a></h3>
<p>A <a href="glossary.html#mechanic">mechanic</a> that is presented as occurring in the literal <a href="glossary.html#game-world">game world</a>.
For example, most user interfaces are presented as something that only exists for the player's convenience, but doesn't exist in the game.
However, in <em>Halo</em>, the display is part of the soldier's visor, and thus literally exists in the game.</p>
<p>Antonym: <strong>non-diagetic</strong></p>
<h3 id="double-edged"><a class="header" href="#double-edged">Double-edged</a></h3>
<p>An <a href="glossary.html#upgrade">upgrade</a> or other <a href="glossary.html#mechanic">mechanic</a> that has both benefits and drawbacks.
These are typically stronger than their strictly positive equivalents in order to be <a href="glossary.html#interesting-choices">balanced</a>.</p>
<h3 id="early-game-mid-game-and-late-game"><a class="header" href="#early-game-mid-game-and-late-game">Early game, mid game and late game</a></h3>
<p>These are broad stages of a game, which proceed one after another.</p>
<p><a href="glossary.html#depth-and-complexity">Total complexity</a> typically increases as the game unfolds, as the complexity budget is often limited by the rate at which players can learn and master new mechanics.</p>
<h3 id="focus-game-design"><a class="header" href="#focus-game-design">Focus (game design)</a></h3>
<p>A game is said to be focused if it has a clear goal and its <a href="glossary.html#system-game-design">systems</a> are  built to serve that goal.</p>
<h3 id="flavor-text"><a class="header" href="#flavor-text">Flavor text</a></h3>
<p>Writing (or sometimes other elements by analogy) that has no <a href="glossary.html#mechanic">mechanical</a> impact or explanation,
and instead serves to enhance the theme and tone of the game.</p>
<h3 id="game-feel"><a class="header" href="#game-feel">Game feel</a></h3>
<p>How satisfying, smooth, intuitive and natural a game feels to play.
Games with great game feel start to feel like extensions of the player's body as they master the game.</p>
<h3 id="genre"><a class="header" href="#genre">Genre</a></h3>
<p>A cluster of related games.
These can be explained either by definition (where you list key properties of games in the genre) or by example (where you list games that fall into the genre and those that do not).</p>
<h3 id="hook-game-marketing"><a class="header" href="#hook-game-marketing">Hook (game marketing)</a></h3>
<p>The unique selling point of a game, that draws interest and encourages players to try out and keep playing your game instead of the competitors in your genre.</p>
<h3 id="hook-game-systems"><a class="header" href="#hook-game-systems">Hook (game systems)</a></h3>
<p>A reusable game <a href="glossary.html#mechanic">mechanic</a> that can be used to connect <a href="glossary.html#system-game-design">game systems</a>, increasing <a href="glossary.html#cohesion">cohesion</a> and <a href="glossary.html#depth-and-complexity">depth</a>.</p>
<h3 id="interesting-choices"><a class="header" href="#interesting-choices">Interesting choices</a></h3>
<p>Games are sometimes said to be a &quot;series of interesting choices&quot;.
In order for choices to be interesting, players must be able to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Understand the choices they have</li>
<li>Understand the implication of each choice</li>
<li>Care about the impact that the choice has on the game</li>
<li>Decide differently based on game conditions</li>
</ol>
<p>Choices are said to be <strong>balanced</strong> if they provide roughly equivalent benefits (or drawbacks) to the players.</p>
<h3 id="lens-game-analysis"><a class="header" href="#lens-game-analysis">Lens (game analysis)</a></h3>
<p>A perspective on the design of a game.
See <a href="https://schellgames.com/art-of-game-design">the deck of lenses</a> for an excellent set of questions to ask about your games.</p>
<h3 id="loop"><a class="header" href="#loop">Loop</a></h3>

This is the core of <a href="glossary.html#worldbuilding">worldbuilding</a>, and sets the basic rules of the fictional universe.</p>
<p>Can be described using:</p>
<ul>
<li>very broad terms like &quot;sci-fi&quot;</li>
<li>more specific like &quot;colonial fantasy focused on the war between burgeoning powers&quot;</li>
<li>hearken to specific media like &quot;Diablo&quot; or &quot;Bladerunner&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>This can be extended to discuss the <strong>big questions</strong> that a game is attempting to explore, like &quot;what does it mean to be human&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="tone"><a class="header" href="#tone">Tone</a></h3>

<h3 id="belt"><a class="header" href="#belt">Belt</a></h3>
<p>A belt is a simple logistic entity which transports goods in a single direction.
Multiple belts need to be chained together to provide effective transportation.
Belts usually have a maximum amount of goods they can transport per unit of time.
They can transport any type of solid goods and different goods can be mixed.</p>
<p>Notably, in Factorio, belts have two &quot;sides&quot;, where each side can contain different types of items.
The direction from which items are loaded onto the belts influence which side of the belt the items are put on.</p>
<p><strong>Examples</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wiki.factorio.com/Transport_belt">Factorio: Transport belt</a></li>

</ul>
<h3 id="bot"><a class="header" href="#bot">Bot</a></h3>
<p>Bots are units which can automate specific player actions.
They often require a lot more upfront investments than machines, but are a lot more flexible.
Compared to machines, bots can move around freely.
Some actions can only be automated through bots, e.g. constructing new entities.</p>
<p><strong>Examples</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wiki.factorio.com/Construction_robot">Factorio: Construction robot</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.factorio.com/Logistic_robot">Factorio: Logistic robot</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="blueprint"><a class="header" href="#blueprint">Blueprint</a></h3>
<p>Blueprints are placeholders for multiple entities to be constructed.
Entity settings (e.g. recipes or other configurations) are preserved in the blueprint.
They can serve as a planning tool for the player, but also be used as instructions for bots.
Often, blueprints can be shared between players and/or be reused during the game.</p>
<p><strong>Examples</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wiki.factorio.com/Blueprint">Factorio: Blueprint</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.factorio.com/Ghost">Factorio: Ghost</a></li>
<li><a href="https://satisfactory.wiki.gg/wiki/Blueprint_Designer">Satisfactory: Blueprint designer</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="clipboard"><a class="header" href="#clipboard">Clipboard</a></h3>
<p>Similar to blueprints, the clipboard allows the quick reuse of factory layouts.
A set of entities can be marked to be copied and then pasted at a different position at a later time.
Usually, the entities are not built directly, but only pasted as placeholders.</p>
<p>In contrast to blueprints, players can usually only have one layout in the clipboard.
Previously copied layouts are simply overwritten.</p>
<p><strong>Examples</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wiki.factorio.com/Controls#Tools">Factorio: Controls/Tools</a> (copy/paste/cut)</li>

<h3 id="loader"><a class="header" href="#loader">Loader</a></h3>
<p>An entity that can load or unload the contents of a container as fast as the input/output belt can handle.
In many games (like Mindustry), this is built into assemblers directly and inserters simply don't exist.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-128">Factorio</a>, where it was initially considered but ultimately not included</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="logistic-network"><a class="header" href="#logistic-network">Logistic network</a></h3>
<p>A network of connected logistic elements that can interact with each other.
It's composed of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>producers</strong>, who provide resources to the network</li>
<li><strong>consumers</strong>, who take resources out of the network and use them</li>
<li>the connection between these nodes</li>
</ul>
<p>A single entity might be both a producer and a consumer.
In the same game there may be different separated sets of logistic networks.
The consumers in the network (e.g. logistic bots) can access the producers in the network (e.g. logistic chests), but not outside of it.</p>
<p><strong>Examples</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wiki.factorio.com/Logistic_network">Factorio: Logistic network</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="map"><a class="header" href="#map">Map</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>marking important locations</li>
<li>recording what to do next</li>
<li>ideas for potential improvements</li>
<li>explanations of why weird decisions were made</li>
</ul>
<p>Serves as a combination of programming comments, map annotations and project management tools.</p>
<h3 id="overlay"><a class="header" href="#overlay">Overlay</a></h3>
<p>Overlays are UI elements which allow the player to view additional information about entities or processes.
They help convey information that is not easily visible by the in-game graphics alone.
The player can switch between different overlays to access different types of information or disable them entirely.</p>
<p><strong>Examples</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Factorio: &quot;Alt mode&quot;</li>
<li><a href="https://oxygennotincluded.fandom.com/wiki/Overlays">Oxygen Not Included: Overlays</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pipette"><a class="header" href="#pipette">Pipette</a></h3>
<p>The pipette is a tool to select an entity and/or its configuration directly from the screen.
It works similarly to copy/paste functionality with the <a href="glossary.html#clipboard">clipboard</a>, but for a singular entity.
This is usually a UI tool instead of a physical tool to build in the game.</p>
<h3 id="power"><a class="header" href="#power">Power</a></h3>
<p>Power is a special type of resource that is required for machines to run.
Power needs to be produced and then distributed to the machines.
Often, there are different means of production (e.g. steam power, solar power, nuclear power) with different upfront costs and production rates.
The distribution of power is usually separated from the distribution of other resources
(e.g. through an electric network).</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="recipe-1"><a class="header" href="#recipe-1">Recipe</a></h3>
<h3 id="research"><a class="header" href="#research">Research</a></h3>
<p>Research is the main means of progression.
Researching new technologies unlocks more machines, enables more advanced processes or improves existing features.
Research is usually very expensive to pace the game.</p>
<p><strong>Examples</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wiki.factorio.com/Research">Factorio: Research</a></li>
<li><a href="https://satisfactory.wiki.gg/wiki/Milestones">Satisfactory: Milestones</a></li>

<ol>
<li>Sand: large particles. Drains well, but water storage capacity suffers.</li>
<li>Silt: medium particles. Pretty balanced.</li>
<li>Clay: small particles. Drains terrible, but with great water storage capacity.</li>
<li>Organic matter: used to be living stuff, carefully prepared and mixed in the soil. Great drainage and water storage, but decomposes.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="water-cycle"><a class="header" href="#water-cycle">Water cycle</a></h3>

<h3 id="signal"><a class="header" href="#signal"><a href="signals/index.html">Signal</a></a></h3>
<p>Every physical object in the game emits signals that correspond to their identity.
These spread over time, and are used for pathfinding and work prioritization.
There are three flavors of signal:</p>
<ul>
<li>presence</li>
<li>supplying (a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban#Operation">&quot;push&quot;</a> signal)</li>
<li>requesting (a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban#Operation">&quot;pull&quot;</a> signal)</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on their needs and preferences, units will proactively pick up items from buildings that are supplying items,
and move them to buildings that are requesting items of that type (or simply storing those items).
Alternatively, units will proactively carry items away from buildings that are supplying them.</p>
<p>As a result, signals serve as both a pathfinding tool and a <a href="glossary.html#logistic-network">logistic network</a> to transport goods through the factory.</p>
