## Long Description

Humanity has gone extinct: victim to its own hubris and waste.
But life itself lives on, and a new form of civilization has begun to emerge:
a symbiotic cross-species emergent intelligence,
snowballing from a simple ant-plant-fungi system as more and more species are domesticated and ultimately assimilated.

Guide this civilization as it grows, adapts and evolves in a challenging dynamic environment.
Fight to build a robust, sustainable system, and fall in love with a factory builder unlike anything you've ever seen before.

The world is your playground: shape the earth, build elaborate terrace or canal systems, and float goods downriver.
A light touch is key: direct your units by controlling their preferences for the **signals** that waft from all things, and create elaborate factories by carefully zoning areas for the plants and fungi that serve as your production and refinement facilities.
Tend to their needs, prune back their uncontrolled spread, and reap the rewards of your careful stewardship.

But when you're only a few centimeters in length, the world is a terribly unstable place!
A rain storm becomes a great flood, predators are terrifying monsters, a fallen tree can level an entire district, and a dead animal presents an unprecedented windfall of nutrients.
Day and night become your metronome, while the changing seasons force you to completely rethink your entire economy.
Unchecked, disease can ravage your populace, while your very resource stores are ripe to be raided!
**Robustness** is key.
If you want to gather the raw materials needed to progress, much less combine them into the end products needed to take your colony to the next level via complex supply chains, you must learn to take advantage of your good fortune, while ensuring you can survive and adapt to the misfortune.

Of course, not all problems are mere bad luck.
As your predecessors learned, the most insidious problems are often those of your own making.
Simply dumping your waste works fine to begin with, but eventually these unmanaged **externalities** will begin to catch up to you:
degrading the soil, polluting water bodies and piling up in ever-growing mounds.
Close the loop, reprocess and repurpose your waste, and turn the problem on its head.

To grow, adance and overcome these problems, your colony-civilization requires new options.
New technology comes in two forms: the **evolution** of existing species in your civilization and the **assimilation** of new ones.
Speciate existing species as many times as you'd like, and create specialized strains uniquely suited to specific tasks by selecting powerful evolutionary traits that come with tangible downsides.

But when you need something truly different, you must master new techniques, and expand into the untamed wilds.
There, you will encounter completely new species (like mycorrhizae, carnivorous plants, flying bees and predatory spiders) and, through hard work and clever thinking, domesticate them.
Over time, they will become fully assimilated, providing radically new capabilities for your colony and unlocking the ability to shape both their preferences and the course of their evolution.

Join us, for together we are stronger.
