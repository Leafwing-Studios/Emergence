# Genre Analysis: Factory Builders

## Defining Games

- Factorio
  - colonize an alien planet and launch a rocket
- Satisfactory
  - open world first person factory building
- Shapez.io
  - abstract factory puzzles
- Dyson Sphere Program
  - gather resources from an entire solar system

## Defining characteristics

- automated resource extraction
- automation resource refinement
- micro-optimizations
- gated technology progression

## Adjacent Genres

- Base and city builders
  - Build out a complex and delightful area, but with no / little automation
- Zachlike puzzles
  - Micro-optimization as an entire game
- Colony sims
  - Balance complex systems, but with a focus on the needs of your workers, not scaling production
- Idle games
  - Automate everything, but without the complex chains
- Train simulators
  - Focusing almost entirely on logistic networks powered by trains

## Blended Genre Games

- Mindustry (tower defense)
- Hydroneer | Astroneeer | Atrio (exploration)
- Automachef (Zachlike + cooking game)
- Infinifactory (Zachlike)
- Timberborn (city builder)

## Progression Loop

- explore
- find resource patch
- exploit resource
- refine resource
- build into science
- unlock new technology
- optimize base with new technology
- explore to find new resource type to exploit

## Sources of Challenge

- player-driven optimization
- resource refinement puzzles
- logistics layout
- (optional) combat disrupting operations
- (optional) temporal variation creating unstable

## Design Tensions

- complexity vs meaningful richness
- helpful innovations vs trivializing the game
- disruption forces interesting changes vs frustration and sadness to see your stuff get wrecked
- long play time vs tedious waiting around
- player fantasy of being in the game vs annoyance of inventory space and walking times
- giant automated bases vs computational limits

## Standard Mechanics

- technology
  - process and spend resources to unlock new options
- blueprints + copy-paste
- assembling machines
  - select a recipe for what you want to make
  - often specialized variants
- resource extraction
  - usually but not always spatially limited
  - often but not always non-renewable
- raw materials, intermediates and end products
- electricity
- conveyer belts
  - moves items from place to place
- inserters
  - loads items to and from assembling machines and chests
- chests
  - stores goods
- (optional) bots
  - takes goods from source to destination in a smarter but more expensive way
- (optional) trains
  - moves huge amounts of goods at once, but with expensive infrastructure and large batches

## Common Problems

- mediocre combat
  - poorly integrated
  - frustrating
  - snowbally
  - thematically incoherent
  - difficult to balance
- poorly managed complexity in UX
- poor tutorialization
- bland, unoriginal aesthetics
- unoriginal mechanisms
- extreme reliance on external guides
- weak environmental variability
- copy-paste of optimized designs
- treadmill-style tech progression
- terrain modification that makes the world less interesting

## Drivers of Player Churn

- overwhelming UI and bad control at start of game
- no clear goal at any point
- tedious tasks
- poor pacing
- performance issues

## Expected Business Model

- early access
- sandbox
- live service development
- (optional) modding
- (optional) small group multiplayer
- (optional) expansions
- NO costmetic microtransactions
- NO pay-to-win
