# Technology

**Technology** represents acquired knowledge of the colony.
It can be used to unlock 3 categories of upgrades:

1. New buildings.
2. New recipes.
3. Player tools.

Improving technology is fairly straightforward:

1. Select a technology choice whose prerequiste technologies have already been researched.
2. Produce tech points of the appropriate varieties until the technology is paid for.

## Acquiring technology points

*Emergence* leans directly on genre conventions for technology research.
There are several varieties of **technology points**.
These are produced via a **research recipe**, which is crafted at a specific **research building** using **research ingredients**.
When the recipe is complete, tech points of the correct variety will be supplied.
These recipes cannot be crafted if there is no use for the tech points.

We diverge from base Factorio in several ways however:

- each variety of science requires a unique research building
- research recipes can have other crafting requirements, such as requiring workers, only being able to be performed in the dark, or needing cold temperatures
- research buildings are sometime reused to craft other recipes

## Building and recipes

These make up the majority of the technology upgrades.
Each of these upgrades either:

- unlocks a useful end product or structure, and any new recipe needed to create it
- provide an alternative way to create an already useful good

Critically, new recipes are never unlocked without a use.
This avoids "dead" upgrades, and encourages players to immediately play with the research they unlocked.
