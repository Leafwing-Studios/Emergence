# Domestication

When the player **domesticates** a species, they domesticate it, learning how to care for and reproduce it, and bringing it into the broader multi-species hive.

Domestication serves several gameplay purposes:

1. Gate wildly different technology in a visually distinctive way.
2. Tutorialize the process of caring for a new species.
3. Give players a reason to care about and get excited by the flora and fauna they see around them.
4. Encourage players to explore new areas.

In order to domesticate a species you must:

1. Study the species in the wild for a time.
   1. You must observe key life cycle events, which unlocks that section of their encyclopedia entry.
2. Capture a number of specimens of a species.
3. Keep that population alive for several life cycles.

Once you have domesticated a new species, you unlock control over [guided evolution](guided-evolution.md) for that species, and can build reproductive structures for that species.

## Implied Constraints

- players should be able to tame almost anything they meet
- players must be able to clearly differentiate between tamed and wild organisms of the same type
- species must be mechanically and visually distinct
  - you cannot have 3 species of dragonflies!
  - this is because players must be able to clearly tell when an encountered species is new to them
- there must be a moderate number of species in the game
  - with too few species, players will get bored
  - with too many species, finding and understanding each species will explode complexity and development costs
- exploration becomes an important game mechanic
  - map cannot start fully visible
  - different species must live in different regions
- each species must have an interesting life cycle that players must learn about and master
  - survival, feeding and reproduction are the obvious choices
  - unique / interesting / challenging behavior is also a good option
- progression must be robust: there must be many paths to the same resources and comparable tools
  - each pathway should feel meaningfully distinct: this plays well with unique life cycles
