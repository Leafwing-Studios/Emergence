# Creative Automation

The core experience of factory builders is that of **creative automation**.
This is an important idea, so let's break down exactly what that means, and what supports and interferes with that experience.

## What is automation?

**Automation** is simple enough: things happening in a repetitive fashion without manual intervention.
This might be cars being riveted in an assembly line, the grinding of wheat into flour, or even the experience of watching crops grow.

Automation is satisfying in the same way that **contraptions** are:
you get to see the intricate parts working together in harmony, marvel at the complexity, and zoom in to understand how each part works.

Good contraptions are:

- full of interesting sounds and motions
- work together to achieve a common goal
- able to be understood by analyzing each part in isolation
- complex enough that they cannot be understood immediately

However, automation can be distinguished from pure contraptions because it accomplishes a **goal**.
These are not pure toys, endlessly pushing a ball up a hill.
Instead, they perform a task: commonly working with **resources**.
Resources are **produced** in some way, then **transformed**, and ultimately **consumed** to acheive some goal.
