# Hive Mind Upgrades

High-level play of factory builders involves understanding a *tremendous* amount of information and using an enormous number of [quality of life](../glossary.md#quality-of-life) tools.
This can be overwhelming, and detracts from the new player experience.
However, simply excluding these tools makes managing late-game factories effectively very hard, and will frustrate genre veterans.

To deal with this tension, many of these tools are traditionally buried in menu settings, hidden behind keybinds or relegated to mods.
However, there's a better approach: enable them slowly over time in a [diagetic](../glossary.md#diagetic) way.

In *Emergence*, the player controls the hive as a whole.
We can play into this theme by framing quality of life and information upgrades as the hive mind getting smarter.

To differentiate these further from [genetics](genetics.md) research, these upgrades don't cost resources.
Instead, they unlock as various [achievements](../glossary.md#achievements) are completed for each playthrough.

Each upgrade can be toggled on-and-off freely in the same menu, so players can control the information they're viewing.
When unlocked, these begin in the off state, but an alert notifies the player that they've unlocked a new hive mind upgrade.

## Upgrade options

Several categories of upgrade belong here:

- basic upgrades
  - these are too important to [early game](../glossary.md#early-game-mid-game-and-late-game) [quality of life](../glossary.md#quality-of-life) and [tutorialization](../glossary.md#tutorialization) to be gated behind all but the most basic achievements
  - alerts
  - undo/redo
  - pipette
  - clipboard
  - basic encyclopedia
  - zoning strength
  - pheromones
  - terraforming
  - map
- informational upgrades
  - local, regional and global production statistics
  - recipe lookups
  - organism statistics
  - soil and water statistics
  - signal overlays
  - status overlays
  - organism intent and actions
  - expanded encyclopedia entries
- simulation upgrades
  - this is a special creative mode, used to test designs quickly and at no cost
  - time is paused while in this mode
  - further upgrades unlock the ability to further modify environmental conditions, speed up time, get more space and so on
  - production planner capabilties belong in this tree
- quality-of-life upgrades
  - blueprints
  - customizable alerts
  - map notes
- complexity upgrades
  - assimilation
  - genetics research
  - maximum number of strains of each species
  - tame and perform genetics research on multiple species at once
  - complex game mechanics unlocked via genetics research
  - research queues

Players can choose to opt out of this system during [world generation](../glossary.md#world-generation), allowing them to access all of the complexity at the very beginning.
This is mostly useful for genre veterans and experienced players.

## Implied constraints

- *Emergence* must have an achievement system
- achievements must be tracked on a per-playthrough basis
- achievements used in this system should be achievable in every playthrough by every player
- achievements should show progress towards the goal
- achievements should be conceptually tied to the type of tool they unlock
  - informational upgrades should come when you need that new information for example
- we must have a handful of very basic achievements to unlock the key early-game tools and introduce these systems to players ASAP
- this system of upgrades is one of the main forms of [tutorialization](../glossary.md#tutorialization)
- achievements must be shared between players in a multiplayer game
- each achievement should have a run-specific in-game reward
