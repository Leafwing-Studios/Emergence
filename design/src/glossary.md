### Belt

A belt is a simple logistic entity which transports goods in a single direction.
Multiple belts need to be chained together to provide effective transportation.
Belts usually have a maximum amount of goods they can transport per unit of time.
They can transport any type of solid goods and different goods can be mixed.

**Examples**:

- [Factorio: Transport belt](https://wiki.factorio.com/Transport_belt)
- [Satisfactory: Conveyor belt](https://satisfactory.fandom.com/wiki/Conveyor_Belt)
- [Dyson Sphere Program: Conveyor belt](https://dyson-sphere-program.fandom.com/wiki/Conveyor_Belt)

### Bot

Bots are units which can automate specific player actions.
They often require a lot more upfront investments than machines, but are a lot more flexible.
Compared to machines, bots can move around freely.
Some actions can only be automated through bots, e.g. constructing new entities.

**Examples**:

- [Factorio: Construction robot](https://wiki.factorio.com/Construction_robot)
- [Factorio: Logistic robot](https://wiki.factorio.com/Logistic_robot)

### Blueprint

Blueprints are placeholders for multiple entities to be constructed.
They can serve as a planning tool for the player, but also be used as instructions for bots.
Often, blueprints can be shared between players and/or be reused during the game.

**Examples**:

- [Factorio: Blueprint](https://wiki.factorio.com/Blueprint)
- [Factorio: Ghost](https://wiki.factorio.com/Ghost)
- [Satisfactory: Blueprint designer](https://satisfactory.fandom.com/wiki/Blueprint_Designer)

### Clipboard

Similar to blueprints, the clipboards allows the quick reuse of factory layouts.
A set of entities can be marked to be copied and then pasted at a different position at a later time.
Usually, the entities are not built directly, but only pasted as placeholders.

In contrast to blueprints, players can usually only have one layout in the clipboard.
Previously copied layouts are simply overwritten.

**Examples**:

- [Factorio: Controls/Tools](https://wiki.factorio.com/Controls#Tools) (copy/paste/cut)
- [Dyson Sphere Program: Mass Construction (Lv1)](<https://dyson-sphere-program.fandom.com/wiki/Mass_Construction_(Lv1)>) (enables copy/paste functionality)
